## Abstract

This study details our efforts to predict the likelihood of experiencing a stroke using a mix of demographic, physical health, and behavioral variables through a logistic regression model. We utilized demographic factors such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity in our model, alongside health indicators including heart health, family history of stroke, smoking status, BMI, and Diabetes status. By analyzing data from the StrokeHealth Outcomes (SHOUT) database, the logistic regression model will identify statistically significant predictors of stroke risk, accounting for potential confounders and interactions between variables. The findings, as they pertain to predictive success and relevant predictor variables, will inform strategic medical/public health interventions that aim to reduce stroke burden by identifying high-risk populations and modifiable risk factors. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to our understanding of stroke determinants and guide preventive strategies to improve public health outcomes. Our study highlights meaningful relationships between patients' health and demographic info such as age and gender, in addition to the complexity that varied socio-demographics present when trying to understand medical outcomes.
